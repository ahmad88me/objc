# objc

## learned from Harvard Objective C class

In the .h file:
```
@interface Foo: NSObject{
  // instace variables
}
//declatations of methods
@end
```
* So `@interface` means class in Java
* Foo is the name of the class
* `:` means extends
* `NSObject` is a class in Foundation library

In the .m file:
```
@implementation Foo
// definitions of methods
@end
```
